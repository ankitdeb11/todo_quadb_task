##### To use this web app, user must have access to Node JS, React, Express and Mongo. 
 - Navigate to the api folder and run the command "npm start"
 - This must ignite the web app to start the backend functionality
 - We have used Express JS and Mongo DB for our database.



 -  Now navigate to the client folder and start the terminal in VS code.
 -  Run the command "npm install".
 -  Run another command "npm run dev" and that should do the work to run the web app on the device's localhost.
 -  Please execute the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the buttons and toggle options in the app.
